# Linked List Arithmetic Project

## Overview
This project implements arithmetic operations on large integers using a custom **linked list data structure**. Instead of relying on built-in numeric types, numbers are represented digit-by-digit, allowing operations on values of arbitrary size.

The project was completed as part of **CSC 203: Project-Based Object-Oriented Programming and Design**.

## Key Features
- Custom linked list representation for large integers
- Support for arithmetic operations including:
  - Addition
  - Multiplication
  - Exponentiation
- Object-oriented design with clear separation of responsibilities
- File-based input and output handling
- Robust handling of edge cases such as carries, zero values, and large inputs

---

## Technical Details
- Each digit of a number is stored as a node in a linked list
- Arithmetic operations are implemented manually to mirror hand calculations
- Uses both iterative and recursive approaches where appropriate
- Designed to handle numbers significantly larger than standard integer limits

---

## What I Learned
- Implementing non-trivial data structures from scratch
- Applying object-oriented design principles to manage complexity
- Translating mathematical logic into maintainable code
- Debugging pointer-based data structures and edge cases
- Writing clear, readable code under real project constraints
